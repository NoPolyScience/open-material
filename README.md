# OpenMaterial

As the second project of 
NoPolyScience, I'd like to announce OpenMaterial which is a blockchain-based network consisting of a consortium of academic institutions. OpenMaterial can be utilized in distributing, reviewing and verifying scientific data.

Academic institutions in the network will no longer need an intermediary to come to consensus on scientific data which would otherwise be marketed. We believe that if a scientist enlightens an unknown part of the nature, everyone around the globe should be able to reach that knowledge for free. Science is what makes the world modern, but we are developing this project to make the scientific progress modern as well.

As for the blockchain solutions, we are exploring a few options. For now, we are developing our own network as a Proof of Concept. We welcome any contributions to our project.
